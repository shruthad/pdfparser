You are an expert data scientist analyzing classification model errors.

### Text:
"My payment went through, but I haven’t received my refund yet."

### Predicted class:
Payment Failure
- Description: Issues where payments fail due to gateway or transaction errors.
- Top features: ["transaction failed", "gateway timeout", "card declined", "error processing payment"]

### Actual class:
Refund Request
- Description: Customer complaints where refunds are delayed or not received.
- Top features: ["refund", "money not received", "return", "credit to account", "processing delay"]

**Analysis:**
The model likely predicted “Payment Failure” because of the phrase “payment went through,” matching strong payment-related keywords.  
However, the context (“haven’t received my refund”) signals a post-payment issue tied to refunds.  
This confusion arises from overlapping vocabulary (“payment,” “failed,” “money”).  
Improving context-aware embeddings or training with more refund-related samples mentioning “payment” can reduce such errors.
