Hi Arjun,
I hope you’re doing well.
I’m following up on the issue I’m facing while trying to raise an Active Directory AIM request for Break Glass access. As mentioned earlier, I’ve already submitted an ART request (as per Step 4 in the Confluence page), and it has been marked as Completed. However, I’m still encountering difficulties at Step 5 (AIM process).
The system displays an error stating that my user ID does not have EFP/Production RSA group access, even though the RSA group access request has been submitted and completed in ART. I’ve also attached a screenshot showing the error message and ART confirmation details for your reference.
Could you please help me verify if I have actually received the requested Break Glass access or guide me on any next steps needed to resolve this?
Thank you for your time and support.
Best regards,
Shrutha D
