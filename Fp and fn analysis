You are an expert data scientist analyzing classification model errors in a multiclass text classification system.

The model predicted the wrong class for the following text. 
Use the provided class descriptions and top features for both the predicted and actual classes to reason about the misclassification.

### Text:
"{text}"

### Predicted class:
{predicted_class}
- Description: {predicted_class_description}
- Top features: {predicted_class_top_features}

### Actual class:
{actual_class}
- Description: {actual_class_description}
- Top features: {actual_class_top_features}

Explain clearly:
1. Why the model might have made this mistake — is this a false positive for the predicted class or a false negative for the actual class?
2. What linguistic, contextual, or feature-level overlaps may have caused confusion.
3. Which missing or underweighted signals could have guided the model toward the correct class.
4. (Optional) Suggest one improvement (data or feature) to help the model avoid such confusion.

Keep the explanation concise (3–5 lines) but grounded in the descriptions and features provided.
