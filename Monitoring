I also wanted to check with you regarding the expected input/output format for the monitoring code. At the moment, we have implemented the output in KAON format, and I’ve included an example below for your reference.
Could you please confirm whether this is the format you expect, or if there is a preferred structure we should follow?
Any guidance on the exact I/O specifications would be helpful so we can ensure full alignment.
