In our team, when we want to appreciate someone‚Äôs support, we usually do it verbally in monthly calls. While this is great in the moment, the recognition often gets forgotten soon after.
Idea:
Let‚Äôs make appreciation more structured, lasting, and motivating by introducing a ‚ÄúPeer Thanking App‚Äù built on Microsoft 365.
At the start of every month, each team member gets 100 points.
They can distribute these points among colleagues who helped them ‚Äî but not themselves.
Every allocation is logged, and a Power BI leaderboard shows the top appreciated colleagues.
Impact:
Encourages a culture of gratitude where everyone actively acknowledges each other‚Äôs efforts.
Recognition becomes visible and measurable instead of being forgotten.
Adds a fun gamification element ‚Äî the top person(s) on the leaderboard can be rewarded with bonus recognition from the manager.
Why this works:
Built fully within M365 tools we already use (Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, SharePoint).
No extra cost, minimal setup, and seamless integration with Teams.
Scalable across teams, with dashboards to spot collaboration trends.
In short:
This app turns casual appreciation into actionable recognition ‚Äî creating a more motivated, engaged, and collaborative team.
Would you like me to also draft a catchy 1-liner tagline you can use in your presentation (e.g., something fun like ‚Äú100 points of gratitude ‚Äì who will be this month‚Äôs appreciation champion?‚Äù)?
