After discussing with Arjun, we followed the steps mentioned in the Confluence page to obtain the break glass/access.
We have completed Step 2 successfully.
In Step 3, we were not able to open the provided link.
For Step 4, we raised an ART request as per the given instructions (which was for the QAEnt domain) and have completed this step — we received the RUID for QAEnt.
As Sudhakar mentioned that the access is required for ADEnt, please confirm if we need to follow the same Step 4 instructions but raise the request for the ADEnt domain instead.
Regarding your second point, I have Python 3.12.8 installed on my system. If development and deployment to the TCOO environment can be done without break glass access, we can proceed accordingly.
