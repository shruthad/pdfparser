Prompting Strategy Breakdown
Simulation of Experts
The system simulates five independent domain experts (Expert 1–5).
Each expert individually assigns:
A Primary Category (mandatory)
A Secondary Category (or “N/A” if not applicable)
Reasoning for both choices
Category Definitions
There are seven strict classification categories:
Product Quality / Durability – build, materials, sturdiness, lifespan
Value for Money – price, affordability, worth, comparison to alternatives
Shipping / Delivery Issues – packaging, timing, tracking, delivery condition
Ease of Use / User Experience – installation, usability, navigation, friendliness
Customer Service Experience – support, returns, refunds, post-purchase help
Feature Performance – technical functionality and performance (battery, screen, sound, etc.)
No Specific Issue / General Praise – vague positive reviews without focus on any one aspect
Independent Expert Classification
Each expert classifies based on content match with the definitions.
Responses include:
primary_category
secondary_category
reasoning
Aggregation via Majority Vote
The system then determines the final categories using a majority vote among the five experts:
final_primary_category
final_secondary_category (or “N/A” if no consensus)
Input / Output Format
Input: A JSON object with the review text.
Output: JSON with two key-value pairs:
{
  "final_primary_category": "Majority-voted category",
  "final_secondary_category": "Majority-voted category or N/A"
}
