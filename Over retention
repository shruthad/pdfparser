I wanted to reach out for some clarification and to get your input on the overretention calculation KPIs we are working on.
We have currently defined two metrics:
Total Overretention Rate – the proportion of overretained documents relative to the total number of documents.
Degree of Overretention – the amount by which each class exceeds its retention requirement, divided by the total number of predictions.
Both of these metrics apply only to classes with finite retention periods. For classes with infinite retention, we are evaluating two possible approaches:
Option 1: Compute overretention and the degree of overretention only for finite-retention classes and track infinite-retention classes separately.
Option 2: Assign infinite-retention classes a large proxy value (e.g., the maximum retention period) and include them in the standard calculations.
Additionally, would it be useful to compute underretention metrics as well, so we have a more complete assessment of prediction quality?
Could you please share your thoughts or preferences on these options?
