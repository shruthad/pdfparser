I am part of the AIM–NLP team working on the Records Classification initiative. I had submitted an entitlement request to obtain access to the TCOO environment to develop, test, and deploy our NLP classification model. The access is required to perform the following activities:
Build and validate model workflows within the approved TCOO CI/CD framework.
Check in code, trigger builds, and manage deployment pipelines as part of the project deliverables.
Collaborate with the engineering and platform teams to integrate the model components with downstream systems.
Ensure all development activities follow the mandated TCOO governance and security standards.
Since the current access policy allows permissions only for developers who check in code and trigger builds, I wanted to confirm that my role in the project falls under this requirement. As part of the development team, I am directly responsible for creating and maintaining the model codebase, pushing updates, and coordinating deployments—so access to TCOO is essential for timely and compliant execution of project tasks.
Please let me know if any additional information, approvals, or documentation are needed from my side to proceed with granting access.
Thank you for your time and support.
Regards,
Shrutha
